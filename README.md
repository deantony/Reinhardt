This program is helpful for Django developmental servers. 

To use Reinhardt:
1) Go to the "releases" section on Github.
2) Download the .exe and the .pck files. 

To Start a New Django Project:
1) Run the program
2) Click "Start Project"
3) When the file viewer pops up, refresh or select the folder where you want to start the new project. **Note do not create the folder with your project name yet. This is for selecting a "Django" or "Projects" folder where all Django projects are saved. 
4) Type the new project name in the next pop up and press Enter.
5) Click "Load Project" 
6) When the file viewer pops up, refresh or select the folder for your Django project. 

Using Reinhardt for Your Project:
1) "Make Migrations" > runs "python manage.py makemigrations" 
2) "Migrate" > runs "python manage.py migrate"
3) "Run Server" > run "python mange.py runserver" **Note the server needs to be stopped with the "Stop Server" Button.
4) "Stop Server" > Kills the "runserver" command. **Note the "Quit" button also kills the server before closing the application.
